image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/aws_cfn_soci_index_builder_architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this solution sets up the following:

* An Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) to store container images and SOCI artifacts.
* An AWS CloudFormation stack that contains the following resources:
** An Amazon EventBridge rule to detect Amazon ECR image action events and invoke the filtering AWS Lambda function.
** Two AWS Lambda functions to do the following:
*** Filter Amazon ECR image action events that match the filters provided in the CloudFormation stack parameters.
*** Generate SOCI indices for matching images and push indices back to image repositories in the Amazon ECR registry.
** AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to provide the following permissions:
*** EventBridge to invoke the filtering Lambda function.
*** Filtering Lambda function to create Amazon CloudWatch logs and to invoke the SOCI index generator Lambda function.
*** SOCI index generator Lambda function to create CloudWatch logs and access the Amazon ECR registry.
* CloudWatch to collect logs from both Lambda functions for troubleshooting.
